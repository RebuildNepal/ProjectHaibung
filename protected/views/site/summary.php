        <p>As the destruction unraveled before us, the meaning of our lives and priorities also took a
         new direction. We want Nepal to rise, and rise BETTER & HIGHER this time and want to contribute
         on an individual level to the nation building process.</p>

        <p>We chose not to wait for the government or INGOs/NGOs to come and rebuild schools in Haibung, 
        because it might take a good couple of years. This delay means children dropping out of school for 
        good and going to cities to work in restaurants or as domestic helpers or even as labourers in the 
        brick or garment industries.</p>

        <p>Project Haibung is an initiative by a team of like-minded Nepalese youth who are committed to using 100% 
        of the funds raised to rebuild schools for the benefit of children in Haibung, Nepal. We are also committed 
        to full transparency and accountability of the funds raised and distributed.  Accordingly, we will publish 
        full details of these both on our website and in social media.  All Project Haibung team members are working 
        voluntarily for this cause which means there are no overhead costs.</p>

        <p>Please donate generously and spread the word. We will continue to provide updates and information regarding
        the allocation of funds on our website, and on our Facebook and Twitter pages. Thank you
        all for your support.</p>
