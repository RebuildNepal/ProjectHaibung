        <p>As the destruction unraveled before us, the meaning of our lives and priorities also took a
         new direction. We want Nepal to rise, and rise BETTER & HIGHER this time and want to contribute
         on an individual level to the nation building process.</p>

         <p>We chose not to wait for the government or INGOs/NGOs to come and rebuild schools in Haibung, because
         it might take a good couple of years. This delay means children dropping out of school permanently
         and going to cities for work in a restaurant or as a domestic helper or even as a child labor in a brick
         or garment industries.</p>

        <p>Project Haibung is an initiative by team of likeminded Nepalese youth who is committed to using 100% of the
         funds it raises directly to rebuild schools for the benefit of children in Haibung, Nepal.
         We are also committed to full transparency and accountability of funds raised and distributed,
         which we will post publicly on our website and on social media. All of Project Haibung team members
         are voluntarily working for this cause, which means that there are no overhead costs.</p>

        <p>Please donate generously and spread the word. We will continue to provide updates and information regarding
        the allocation of funds on our website, and on our Facebook and Twitter pages. Thank you
        all for your support.</p>
