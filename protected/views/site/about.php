                        <p>On April 25 when Earthquake tore through central and eastern Nepal, it killed
                            more than 8,500 people; injured thousands and millions of people were left 
                            homeless. The worst of our imaginations was taking shape and we were helplessly
                            following the news and praying for mercy. The city we grew up in, the
                            landscapes that we played growing up turned into a pile of rubble in no time. 
                            This earthquake completely changed our life and our priorities and it is something 
                            that we would not have noticed before. The conversation we have, the lives that 
                            what to lead and little things that makes us happy has changed. Everyone wanted to 
                            help, initiate and contribute to #RebuildNepal.</p>
                            
                            
                        <p>Like every other Nepalese, we got emotionally driven and started looking for ways
                            to extend our helping hand. After a couple of sleepless nights we knocked every
                            door that we could, use social media to raise money from colleagues at work to
                            dispatch some immediate supplies such as water purifiers, foods, sleeping bags, 
                            tents and blankets through Nepalese Army to different parts of Nepal. We all were 
                            working on our own, taking initiative on our own way to help support people in Nepal. 
                            It didn’t take long for us to realize that  “if we work together we could do more”.

                        <p>We are driven to work for this cause from our heart, and we want to make sure every 
                            single dollar that we raise will be used for the victims of the earthquake. We are 
                            a self-motivated team of like-minded people with no hierarchical structure. Each one 
                            of us is committed to push this initiative as far as possible and to reach out to more 
                            communities affected by the devastating earthquake. Education gave us better life, and 
                            we must plant this seed so underprivileged children who are the victim of the earthquake 
                            will have better future. So here we are with Project Haibung.</p>

                        <p>We invite each and every one of you to join us to help #RebuildNepal.</p>
