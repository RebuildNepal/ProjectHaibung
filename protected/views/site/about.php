                        <h3>
                            <a href="#">How we started?
                            </a>
                        </h3>
                        <p>On April 25, a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal, tearing apart the
                            very fabric of our lives. For quite some time, experts had been warning us of this
                            imminent earthquake, but no one could have possibly fathomed the level of destruction
                            that this earthquake would wreak.</p>
                        
                        <p>The earthquake went on to claim the lives of more than 8,500 people, leaving thousands
                            injured and millions homeless. In less than a minute of the ground shaking, the iconic
                            Dharahara tower that once stood as a tall white pillar of hope for the entire nation had fallen.
                            Many ancient temples that were so integral to the Nepalese culture were reduced to rubble.
                            As the destruction unraveled before us, the meaning of our lives and priorities also took a
                            new direction.</p>
 
                        <p>The earthquake initially shook us all but the spirit to help our fellow citizens didn’t take
                            long to arise. After a couple of sleepless nights we started knocking on every door that we could,
                            tirelessly leveraging social media to raise money from colleagues at work to dispatch some
                            immediate supplies such as water purifiers, foods, sleeping bags, tents and blankets through
                            Nepalese Army to different parts of Nepal. Each of us was initially working independently but it
                            didn’t take long for us to realize that if we could harness this into a collective effort and work
                            together, we could do so much more.</p>
 
                        <p>A new sense of unity and integrity has emerged, especially amongst the Nepalese youth who have
                            initiated rebuilding Nepal. We are a part of this movement and are driven to work for this cause from
                            our heart. We are a team of motivated and like-minded people committed towards pushing this initiative
                            as far as possible. Our aim is to ensure that every single dollar we raise is spent on the victims of
                            this earthquake and their communities.</p>
 
                        <p>Our education has given us the opportunity to lead better lives, and we believe that underprivileged
                            children who have become victims of this earthquake should not be stripped off this opportunity. It is
                            essential for these kids to continue going to school so they can study, hope and aspire to have great
                            futures.</p>
 
                        <p>So here we are with Project Haibung. We invite each and every one of you to join us to help #RebuildNepal.</p>
