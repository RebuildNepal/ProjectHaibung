        <p>Project Haibung is an initiative to rebuild Mahadevstan School in Haibung VDC at Sindupalchowk, Nepal which was reduced to rubble during the earthquake of the 25th of April, 2015.</p>
        <p>Around 720 children currently have no access to education, raising concerns regarding their security and academic future.</p>
        <p>We are a team of Nepalese living in Nepal and abroad, working closely with local youth in Haibung. We are determined to provide these children with a safe and secure learning environment.</p>
        <p>This project does not end with the physical buildings. With your help we will continue to support the children of Haibung by providing mentoring, career counseling and scholarship opportunities.</p>
